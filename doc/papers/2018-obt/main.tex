\maketitle

With the rise of lab automation technologies, scientists are writing programs instead
of pen-and-paper protocols.
These programs mix computation with fluidic manipulation,
introducing all the difficulties of traditional programming
\emph{plus} liquid handling problems and domain-specific chemical or biological complexities.

A successful programming solution must not only manage these various complexities,
but also enable scientists' to leverage domain knowledge.
Importantly, the system must be accessible by users who are not programming language experts (or even programmers!).

We believe the programming language community is well-suited
to address these challenges.
We picture a two-fold solution:
a core fluidic semantics to manage the complexities of liquid handling,
and an extensible layer that ensures programs respect user-provided domain-specific properties.
This talk will present how some of
the problems in this area line up with---and sometimes challenge---well understood PL techniques.

\section*{Programming Lab Automation}

Lab automation is coming, with or without the input of programming language experts.
Today, liquid handling devices can automatically manipulate chemical or biological samples
at smaller scales than ever before, saving time and reagents.

Droplet-based microfluidic (DMF) technology is especially promising because of its flexibility.
DMF devices manipulate individual droplets of liquids on a grid of electrodes (\autoref{fig:board}).
Activating electrodes in certain patterns can move, mix, or split droplets anywhere on the chip.
These DMF devices are akin to general-purpose CPUs when contrasted with other liquid handling
technologies whose capabilities are baked into the hardware.
Unfortunately, they suffer from little programming abstraction and high failure rates \cite{dmf-review}.

Programming these devices is similar to other forms of heterogeneous programming in that
it involves a controlling and communicating with a specialized device.
\autoref{fig:code} shows a short pseudocode snippet of a fluidic program.
On top of conventional programming constructs, we have primitives like {\tt mix} and {\tt heat} that manipulate fluids.
Embedded in a general purpose language, users can combine these primitives into complex procedures that mix computation and fluidic manipulation like {\tt get\_pH} and {\tt acidify} in the example.
{\tt get\_pH} also demonstrates how programs can depend on properties of the physical world like the pH of a sample.

    ...
# l4 = mix(l1, l3)
# error!

Fluidic manipulation poses interesting compilation challenges related to placement and routing that we will not cover due to space.
Instead, we will focus on two key questions raised by the combination of programming, liquid handling, and chemistry:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can we help the programmer deal with complexities and high failure rate of liquid handling?
\item How can we reason about programs (like the loop in \autoref{fig:code}) that rely on physical processes from chemistry and biology?
\end{itemize}


% This programming model includes the complexities found in other heterogeneous
% and non-standard programming models, with added complexity introduced by the
% addition of unreliable hardware, and the presence of chemical reactions.

% We believe that ideas from programming languages can be applied to yield safe,
% high-level abstractions that enable scientists to quickly prototype complex,
% reproducible experiments.

% The automation will also be a critical part of a new breed of systems that
% leverage molecular computation. Furthermore, the principled approach will let
% domain experts reason about the correctness of critical processes like
% medical diagnostics.

\section*{Core Fluidic Semantics}

The first step to an effective fluidic programming model is a core semantics.
This semantics should capture notions inherent to liquid handling but generic across any specific domain of
chemistry or biology.

Fluids have physical properties such as volume or location on a DMF device.
Liquid handling primitives like {\tt mix} and {\tt split} affect these properties and add complexity to the program.
Programs that manipulate physical entities are fundamentally resource-oriented: you only have so much of a sample.
Furthermore, these manipulations are error prone on DMF devices: a split may result in loss of precision, for example sample volumes that are slightly off, or failure to split altogether.

We will discuss a few programming language techniques we believe to be applicable in this setting to aid with
resource management and error tolerance.

% mass, and volume, and primitive operations such as splitting  and mixing.
% These primitive actions enable the manipulation of fluids but don't provide domain specific properties.
% For example we could use the hypothetical DMF language to perform chemical reactions, such as mixing and acid and bases but without domain specific extensions would be unable to reason about acid, base reactions.
% We believe the semantics ideally will capture a set of core behaviors around resource consumption, garbage collection, error correction, and approximate probabilistic execution.

\paragraph{Substructual typing}

In programming languages, we use linear or affine logics to enforce \emph{exactly once} or \emph{at-most-once} use of certain variables. When a variable is \emph{consumed}, the type system prevents the program from using it again.
These kinds of semantics are a perfect fit for liquid handling, where
operations like {\tt mix} \emph{physically consume} their inputs.
Such a type system could prevent errors like the one in \autoref{fig:code}.

A more fine-grained notion of substructural typing that enriches variables with a notion of quantity could also be useful.
For example, a {\tt split} operation on a DMF chip may not work if the sample is too small.

\paragraph{Garbage collection}

Garbage collection has made programming safer and more accessible by automating certain forms of resource management.
A similar approach would be useful in liquid handling, where reactions often generate waste.
A runtime system could automatically determine which samples the programmer is no longer using and dispose of them.

Some samples may be too volatile to just be automatically disposed.
One solution would be to use linear semantics which require the user to dispose of them properly.
Alternatively, an affine semantics could employ a Rust-like {\tt Drop} feature that invokes user-defined cleanup when the sample goes out of scope.

\paragraph{Dynamic analysis}

Many of the operations on a DMF device are error-prone, prior work has used sensors and cameras
to detect these errors at runtime \cite{dmf-vision}. Because of their frequency, treating these errors as
user handled exceptions is a non-option; the execution must incorporate automatic error correction.

Simple errors can be fixed by retrying: if a split yields the wrong volume ratio, the runtime can mix them together and retry.
More complex errors will require program analysis to correct. If a sample gets ruined (perhaps by an accidental collision with
another sample), a dynamic analysis like slicing could figure out which parts of the program must be re-run to regenerate the sample.

\paragraph{Probabilistic Complications}

The ideas proposed above do seem to fit some the problems with fluidic programming, but the idiosyncrasies of this domain prevent the off-the-shelf application of these techniques.

Error-prone hardware necessitates some kind of automatic error correction.
This retry logic should improve reliability, but it complicates resource management.
Substructural typing can no longer promise safe resource usage if the runtime system can re-run any part of the program.

Parts of the program involving chemical reactions may have time constraints.
For example, a heated sample should be used before it cools off too much.
Error correction means the system can never guarantee that a program meets timing requirements.

We need to define probablistic error models of the hardware and adapt these techniques to the stochastic environment.
Recent work has recognized the need for a stochastic approach \cite{bioprotocols}, a system that provides high-level, safe liquid handling is still a ways out.

\section*{Domain-specific Extensions}

Researchers have spent decades understanding how chemical and biological systems operate.
Scientists rely on this vast body of knowledge when developing protocols.
Ideally, the programming system would understand the relevant biochemical properties of the protocol and
ensure that the user adheres to it. Attempting to encode a significant fraction of biology or chemistry into the core
formal semantics is impossible, and users would invariably require new semantic models, or ones designed at a different granularity,
as seen in other modeling  and verification tools such as theorem provers. Instead, users should be able to \emph{extend}
the semantics with relevant biochemical properties.

\paragraph{Safety properties}

Many domain-specific properties could be phrased as safety properties: never let substance $X$ mix with substance $Y$, or make sure I use at most 20mL of this solution.
Such properties are easy to assert dynamically, but halting the program at runtime is expensive when the
experiment takes hours to run, and consumes reagents.

Techniques like symbolic execution or abstract interpretation can address this, but they often have trouble scaling to
large systems. Luckily, many of these protocols will be simple in terms of computation and control flow.
If the user can provide the right abstraction over the chemical or biological properties at play, these techniques could statically ensure many properties.
This kind of assurance will be necessary as fluidic devices make their way into safety-critical fields like medicine.

\paragraph{Session types}
Session types are intended to help users describe protocols and enforce that programs adhere to the correct
communication structure. We can view these fluidic programs as protocols that communicate with the natural world.
The correct session type would  ensure that the user takes certain actions in the correct order.

For example, a synthetic biologist may want to ensure DNA amplification \emph{always} occurs before sequencing it.
The user could add domain knowledge to the system by writing down a session type describing the series of events that must occur.
The system can then ensure regardless of what computation occurs, that the program respects the fluidic protocol.

\paragraph{Testing and verification}

We also believe that techniques from testing, verification and bug finding are applicable to DMF.
Our goal is not a focus on full formal verification, but to provide tools which allow users to check and understand their programs.
Many protocols are expensive in time, human labor, and reagents.
The high cost of running the program limits the programmer's ability to iterate.
Static feedback, providing counter examples, and simulation
could allow non-expert programmers to iterate.
