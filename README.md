# Puddle

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uwmisl/puddle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uwmisl/puddle)

Puddle is a system for high-level, reliable programming of microfluidic devices.
Check out the [project page] on the [MISL] website.

## Installation

We use [Git LFS][lfs] to store larger files. If you want to see those larger
files (videos, presentations, etc.) make sure to install it. Once you have it
installed, you can use Git as you usually would.

All the code is written in [Rust][].
A simple `cargo build` in the project root will build everything,
and `cargo test** will run the tests.

## Running Examples

**FIXME** right now there are no examples in the rust code :(
